# python-tkinter-calculator
Calculator Application
This is a simple Calculator Application built using Python and Tkinter. The application allows users to perform basic arithmetic calculations with a graphical user interface (GUI). It supports features such as undo, keyboard input, and animated button feedback.

Keyboard Support: You can type the following directly on your keyboard to interact with the calculator:

Numbers: 0-9
Operators: +, -, *, /
Clear: C (or —Å in Cyrillic)
Equals: Press Enter (\r).
Backspace: Removes the last character entered.
Error Handling: If you enter an invalid expression (e.g., 2++2), the calculator will show an error message.

Code Explanation
Main Components
Button Click Functionality (button_click): This function is triggered when any button is pressed. It processes the user's input and handles:

Arithmetic calculations.
Clearing the entry field.
Updating the display with the appropriate symbols.
Undo Feature (undo): The undo function allows users to revert the last entered value. It works by saving a history of inputs and providing the ability to step back in time.

Keyboard Interaction (key_press and key_release): These functions allow users to interact with the calculator using the keyboard. It listens for keypress events like numbers, operators, Enter, Backspace, and Ctrl + Z.

Button Animation (animate_button): When a user clicks a button, its background color briefly changes to provide visual feedback, making the UI more interactive.

Graphical User Interface:

The interface is built using Tkinter, with buttons arranged in a grid layout.
The entry field displays the current expression or result.
Tkinter Layout
The main window uses a grid layout to arrange the buttons.
